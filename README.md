# Simple Blimp UI

Simple Blimp is a concept idea for a CMS that let's users create APIs by giving them tools to create database tables, API endpoints and security keys.

This is a proof-of-concept UI for this concept CMS.

## Get Started

1. Download repo
2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn start`
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:1234`

You don't need a login. Just click the 'Sign In' button.

## Future

Since this is a proof-of-concept there is a lot of work that can be done. I will be playing with others features on the future.
